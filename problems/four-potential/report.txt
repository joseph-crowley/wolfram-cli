Four-Potential Problem Report

Part (a): Covariant structure of potentials

The spacetime gradient transforms as a covector and the electric and magnetic fields transform together under Lorentz maps. Demanding that spacetime derivatives of a single candidate potential reproduce those field transformations forces the scalar potential and the spatial vector potential to transform together as one four-quantity. Gauge freedom allows addition of a spacetime gradient of a scalar, which preserves the fields. Fixing a covariant gauge removes that ambiguity and leaves a linear Lorentz transformation law for the four-potential.

Part (b): Equipotential cross section

We evaluate the standard retarded scalar potential of a uniformly moving point charge at a fixed laboratory time. The target contour value is chosen so the static case is a unit circle. For nonzero speeds the contours flatten along the motion and expand transversely, forming oblate ellipses. The figure equipotential_cross_section.png overlays four speeds.

Numeric intercepts (units where the static radius is 1)
v/c = 0.3, gamma = 1.048, x-intercept ~ 1.000, y-intercept ~ 1.048
v/c = 0.5, gamma = 1.155, x-intercept ~ 1.000, y-intercept ~ 1.155
v/c = 0.7, gamma = 1.400, x-intercept ~ 1.000, y-intercept ~ 1.400
v/c = 0.9, gamma = 2.294, x-intercept ~ 1.000, y-intercept ~ 2.294
