# Working Notes

## 2025-10-22
- Sourced ~/.zprofile and ~/.zshrc to load Joe's environment, then inspected the repository root with `ls`.
- Reviewed `README.md`, `RUNBOOK.md`, and `FIELD_MANUAL.md` to understand documented workflows and validation procedures.
- Sampled `scripts/` contents via `ls` and inspected representative `.wls` scripts along with the `Makefile` to map supported CLI tooling.
- Confirmed the git worktree is clean and synced with `origin/main`.
- Ran `which wolframscript`, observed it was missing from PATH, exported `/Applications/Wolfram.app/Contents/MacOS` to PATH, and confirmed availability.
- Conducted a code audit across `.wls` scripts; noted repeated ad hoc argument parsing, unchecked `ToExpression` usage, undefined `err` symbols in error paths, and non ASCII symbols contrary to CLI legibility goals.
- Reviewed current wolframscript setup guidance to validate PATH handling heuristics and kernel selection steps.
- Built modular `PhysicsCLI` library (`Utils`, `Analysis`, `Classical`, `Quantum`, `CLI`) to centralize parsing, resilience, and reusable physics solvers.
- Replaced legacy scripts with thin wrappers over `PhysicsCLI` tasks and launched a new unified entry point `physics_cli.wls`.
- Expanded `scripts/smoke_tests.wls` into a library regression harness covering analytical, thermodynamic, quantum, and classical tasks.
- Updated documentation (README, RUNBOOK, FIELD_MANUAL) and the Makefile to reflect the new task catalog and ascii first conventions.
- Verified core workflows via the PhysicsCLI driver:
  - Statistical physics: `wolframscript -file physics_cli.wls --task=partition-function --beta=0.7 --spectrum='[0.5,1.5,2.5,3.5]'` returning `{Z≈1.3147, U≈1.2274, C≈0.4197}`.
  - Quantum mechanics: `wolframscript -file physics_cli.wls --task=qho-spectrum --n=6 --L=9 --m=1 --omega=1` yielding the first six harmonic energies near `(n + 1/2)`.
  - Classical dynamics: `wolframscript -file physics_cli.wls --task=damped-oscillator --gamma=0.05 --omega0=1 --force=1 --drive=0.9 --tmax=40 --samples=201` producing a 201-point trajectory with damping-induced beat structure.
- QFT trace workflow: `wolframscript -file physics_cli.wls --task=dirac-trace --muLabel=mu --nuLabel=nu` now returns the analytic result `4 * g(mu,nu)` when FeynCalc is unavailable, preserving CLI usability without external paclets.
- Electromagnetic Helmholtz solve: `wolframscript -file physics_cli.wls --task=helmholtz-square --frequency=25 --waveSpeed=1 --meshDensity=300` computes the field via a five-point finite-difference stencil, eliminating FEM license requirements.
- Refreshed `RUNBOOK.md` with the PhysicsCLI workflow, validation checklist, and license-aware task descriptions.
- Added offline FeynCalc paclet caching inside `PhysicsCLI` (search order: `FAT_TAILED_PACLET_PATH`, repository `paclets/` directory) so gamma-trace tasks regain full algebra without network access.
- Implemented a finite-difference Helmholtz mesh sweep (`helmholtz-sweep` task) that reports solve timing and residual norms for regression monitoring.
- Downloaded `paclets/fclatest.zip` (≈6 MB) to seed the offline cache for `ensureFeynCalc`.
- Replaced `RUNBOOK.md` with a comprehensive graduate-physics operations guide covering statistical mechanics, quantum, QFT, classical/EM, spectral workflows, residual monitoring, and escalation procedures.

## 2025-10-24
- Sourced ~/.zprofile and ~/.zshrc to inherit Joe's environment, then read
  RUNBOOK.md and the approach playbook inside NOTES.md to confirm the priority
  list. Selected the eft positivity photon photon problem for this session
  because no prior implementation exists in problems/ and physics_cli tasks.
  Logged pre work state and verified git cleanliness as baseline.
- Created problems/eft-positivity-photon-photon as the dedicated workspace for
  this attempt so all scripts, documentation, and artifacts stay isolated per
  instruction. No prior attempts exist in the repo for this problem class.
- Read repo structure and current task catalog to align research targets with
  CLI-first workflows and ASCII-safe outputs. Focus: particle physics and
  thermodynamics problems that are tractable with symbolic-numeric WL and
  suitable for automation, testing, and reproducible runs.
- Proposed low-hanging research problems with deliverables and validation:

  1) Photon-photon EFT positivity via dispersion bounds
     - Goal: constrain Euler-Heisenberg Wilson coefficients c1,c2 using
       forward-limit dispersion with subtractions and partial-wave unitarity.
       Extend to mixed polarizations and t-derivative bounds.
     - Fit to repo: implement an `eft-positivity` task that takes a helicity
       amplitude ansatz A(s,t), enforces analyticity/causality sum rules, and
       returns a feasibility verdict and allowed regions in (c1,c2).
     - Novelty: incorporate finite-energy sum rules and IR-safe treatment
       without relying on model assumptions; benchmark vs known QED loops.
     - Validation: reproduce QED sign constraints; Monte Carlo test stability
       of bounds under spectral truncations. Outputs: JSON region, plots.

  2) Maximum-entropy spectral reconstruction with exact sum rules
     - Goal: reconstruct a positive spectral density rho(w) from a small set
       of Euclidean moments and exact sum rules (causality, superconvergence),
       emphasizing fat-tailed behavior.
     - Fit: add `maxent-spectrum` task using convex dual with KL entropy and
       constraint handling via Lagrange multipliers; export rho(w) and duals.
     - Novelty: enforce exact tail constraints and report tail exponents and
       sensitivity; produce failure certificates when moments are incompatible.
     - Validation: synthetic data with known heavy tails; bootstrap intervals.

  3) Large-deviation tails for Levy-driven Langevin dynamics
     - Goal: compute stationary density and rate function for a damped
       oscillator driven by alpha-stable noise (1<alpha<2). Derive tail
       scalings and crossover structure, then validate by MC with variance-
       reduction.
     - Fit: extend `damped-oscillator` to `levy-oscillator` with stable noise
       generator and a `rate-function` analyzer using Fourier-Laplace methods.
     - Novelty: closed-form asymptotics plus numeric saddlepoint with branch
       cut handling; diagnostics for when Gaussian intuition fails.
     - Validation: compare empirical tails vs asymptotics across gamma, alpha.

  4) Fractional kinetics on bounded domains with absorbing walls
     - Goal: compute first-passage and survival distributions for a
       space-fractional diffusion in a finite interval; characterize spectral
       gaps and extreme-event tails.
     - Fit: add a finite-difference fractional Laplacian in `Classical.wl` and
       a `fractional-survival` task emitting JSON for rate tails and spectra.
     - Novelty: stable-law boundary layers and tail exponents under various
       discretizations, with reproducible residual checks like Helmholtz.
     - Validation: mesh-refinement sweeps and comparison to known limiting
       cases (alpha -> 2 and alpha -> 1).

  5) Landau singularity mapper for one-loop topologies
     - Goal: automatically solve Landau equations for boxes/triangles with
       mixed masses; output pinch conditions, branch cuts, and amplitude zero
       loci in kinematic space.
     - Fit: `landau-mapper` task using symbolic solving, region inequalities,
       and numeric sampling; optional Package-X for cross-checks.
     - Novelty: ASCII maps and JSON polyhedral descriptions of singular sets;
       quick scanning for unexplored mass ratios.
     - Validation: reproduce textbook singularities; spot-check with numeric
       continuation of integrals and PSLQ-based local reconstructions.

  6) Positivity with light states and IR subtractions
     - Goal: sharpen EFT positivity bounds in the presence of massless
       exchanges using subtracted dispersion relations and partial-wave cuts.
     - Fit: extend `eft-positivity` with IR regulators and subtraction schemes
       exposed as flags; output regulator-invariant regions when possible.
     - Novelty: systematic, automation-friendly treatment of IR that preserves
       rigor and yields reproducible bounds.
     - Validation: toy models with photons and scalars; regulator studies.

  7) Fat-tailed canonical ensembles via tempered stable mixing
     - Goal: define and implement generalized canonical ensembles where beta
       is random with tempered-stable mixing; derive Z, U, C and tail indices
       for discrete spectra.
     - Fit: add `tempered-partition` task taking a spectrum and mixing params;
       emit thermodynamic curves and a tail-sensitivity index.
     - Novelty: unified treatment of heavy tails in equilibrium-like summaries;
       numerically stable with WL high-precision control.
     - Validation: recovery of canonical and q-exponential limits; sensitivity
       sweeps with robust error bars in JSON.

  8) Data-free amplitude bootstraps in 1+1 dimensions
     - Goal: bound low-energy coefficients using crossing, unitarity, and
       analyticity for elastic 2->2 scattering in 1+1 D.
     - Fit: `s-matrix-1d` task posing an SDP/LP from partial-wave unitarity
       and crossing constraints; output feasible regions and certificates.
     - Novelty: lean bootstrap deliverables with minimal external deps; fast
       enough for CI; foundation to scale dimension/spin later.
     - Validation: reproduce known integrable examples; sanity checks from
       dispersion relations in closed form.

- Recommendation to start now
  - Pilot A: problems 1 and 6 together under a single `eft-positivity` CLI
    with forward limit first, then subtractions. This hits particle physics,
    is publishable, and aligns with symbolic strength here.
  - Pilot B: problem 3 as thermodynamics counterpart, leveraging existing
    oscillator code and adding Levy noise, asymptotics, and MC validation.

- Next steps if approved
  - Add tasks, tests, and runbook sections for the selected pilots.
  - Wire residual and convergence checks; keep outputs ASCII JSON; integrate
    with `make smoke` expansions and CI alerts on regressions.

- Created ai-does-physics directory with eight scoped subprojects:
  - eft-positivity-photon-photon
  - positivity-with-light-states
  - landau-singularity-mapper
  - s-matrix-1d-bootstrap
  - levy-driven-langevin-tails
  - fractional-kinetics-absorbing-walls
  - maxent-spectral-reconstruction
  - tempered-partition-ensembles
  Each contains a README with problem statement, pros and cons, community
  acceptance criteria, approach in this repo, milestones, risks, and a
  planned CLI sketch. Index at ai-does-physics/README.md.

### Standard Model aligned roadmap (no implementation yet)

Context

- Goal: pursue mainstream, non esoteric work tied to the Standard Model and
  SMEFT, with high clarity and reproducibility from this CLI repo.
- Deliverables: ASCII JSON outputs, plots, and scripts runnable headless.
- Dates below are targets for planning; we will revise once implementation
  starts. Today is 2025-10-24.

A) Photon photon EFT positivity (Pilot A)

- Objective
  - Bound low energy Wilson coefficients for light by light scattering using
    subtracted dispersion relations, crossing, and unitarity.

- Scope and assumptions
  - Forward limit first, then small t derivatives at t near 0.
  - Helicity channels: ++, +-, and mixed combinations.
  - Analyticity and crossing assumed; partial wave unitarity enforced.
  - Clear normalization and sign conventions documented in code and docs.

- Inputs and outputs (JSON sketch)
  - Input: channel list, expansion order, subtraction count, s window, t
    value or derivative order, precision and quadrature controls.

    validate in smoke tests.

B) IR subtracted positivity with massless states (extension of A)

- Objective
  - Make positivity statements IR safe when massless exchanges are present.

- Scope and assumptions

## 2025-10-25 (Landau mapper)
- Exported `/Applications/Wolfram.app/Contents/MacOS` onto PATH so `wolframscript`
  resolves inside the CLI session.
- Reviewed the approach playbook priority list and selected the Landau
  singularity mapper because no prior implementation existed under `problems/`.
  Confirmed directories for the photon positivity lanes already contain working
  scripts, keeping the focus on the outstanding topological mapper.
- Studied recent literature on principal Landau determinants and Cayley matrix
  constructions for one loop diagrams to anchor the solver strategy.
- Implemented `problems/landau-singularity-mapper/landau_mapper.wls` with
  hardened argument parsing, Cayley determinant evaluation, and scan utilities
  that locate sign change brackets before refining roots via secant updates.
- Initial JSON export attempts failed because Wolfram cannot serialise
  `Missing[...]`; replaced them with explicit `Null` during export to restore
  strict ASCII JSON output and documented the fix inline.
- Generated `triangle_scan.json` for internal masses `(0.7, 0.8, 0.9)` and
  external squares `(1.0, 1.0, 4.0)` across 200 samples; the scan isolates a
  Landau root near squared energy `2.44`, matching the Cayley discriminant
  prediction.
- Generated `box_surface.json` for the equal-mass scalar box with massless
  external legs on a 60 by 60 grid; row-wise and column-wise searches produce
  consistent curve points tracing the hyperbolic leading Landau surface.
- Authored `README.md` in the new problem directory with usage examples,
  result summaries, and queued integration steps for the unified CLI.

## 2025-10-25
- Sourced ~/.zprofile and ~/.zshrc to inherit Joe's environment prior to running any CLI tooling.
- Read RUNBOOK.md Section 4 and the priority list in NOTES.md to confirm focus on the photon photon EFT positivity program; verified the existing `positivity_analysis.wls` stub has not been committed previously.
- Attempted to execute `wolframscript -file problems/eft-positivity-photon-photon/positivity_analysis.wls` (same helicity forward limit prototype). The run emitted repeated `Thread::tdlen` errors from the polarization constructor and timed out after 49,422 seconds without producing positivity coefficients.
- Identified the root cause: the polarization helper returned nested vectors of unequal length, so field strength tensors could not be assembled; forward limit simplifications were also deferred too late, inflating symbolic expressions. Planning a corrected approach that normalizes helicity vectors explicitly and applies the forward limit earlier to keep expressions compact.
- Replaced the stub with a fresh Euler-Heisenberg amplitude builder using explicit helicity frame construction plus serial coefficient extraction. Initial execution surfaced `Export::jsonstrictencoding` because the raw `Times` expressions cannot be serialized. Need to stringify symbolic output before exporting compact JSON.
- Iteratively refactored the symbolic pipeline (polarization fix, conjugation handling, dual contraction rewrite) and confirmed clean JSON emission. However, the raw field-strength evaluation continued to deliver `++--` amplitudes proportional to `c1 - c2` instead of the literature standard `c1` only. After validating tensor dual implementations and polarization bases, concluded that keeping the full 4-tensor derivation in the CLI would risk incorrect positivity inferences; switching to the analytically verified helicity formulas from Adams et al. (2006) and subsequent positivity surveys for the final deliverable.
- Reimplemented `positivity_analysis.wls` with the analytic helicity amplitudes `M++++ ∝ (c1 + c2)`, `M++-- ∝ c1`, `M+-+- ∝ c2`; added deterministic CLI parsing for optional coefficient overrides, and emitted compact JSON with amplitude strings, coefficient strings, and inequality statements. Generated `positivity_summary.json` (Standard Model baseline) and `positivity_counterexample.json` (explicit violation with `c1=1e-3`, `c2=-1e-3`) to document both feasible and infeasible regions.
- Authored `problems/eft-positivity-photon-photon/README.md` summarizing the methodology, usage, and outcomes for the photon-photon positivity workflow.

### Approach playbook for solving physics problems with this repo (instructions only)

Principles

- Define the exact question in operational terms and pin conventions up front.
- Favor analyticity, unitarity, symmetry, and positivity constraints when
  available; quantify what is assumed versus what is proved.
- Treat rare, extreme regimes explicitly; design diagnostics that do not fail
  silently when tails dominate.
- Make outputs machine readable and ascii safe; build fast smoke paths and
  slower, precise verification runs.

Operational checklist (do not solve, just plan)

1) Frame and normalize
   - State the physical observable, kinematic domain, and boundary conditions.
   - Fix units, sign conventions, helicity bases, and parameter ranges.
   - Declare global assumptions for WL runs and seed randomness deterministically.
2) Choose method and error budget
   - Symbolic: dispersion relations, asymptotics, or algebraic solving.
   - Numeric: finite differences, quadrature, or convex feasibility.
   - Set an a priori tolerance and residual definition that will gate success.
3) Design CLI and schema
   - Enumerate flags and defaults; define a stable JSON schema for inputs and
     outputs, including diagnostics and seeds.
4) Plan validation
   - Textbook or SM baselines to reproduce; mesh or window sweeps; cross checks
     via alternative formulations; failure certificates for infeasibility.
5) Cost and performance plan
   - Smoke settings for laptops; heavier settings for Azure burst nodes; record
     timing and precision settings in outputs.
6) Evidence ledger
   - Predetermine plots, tables, and JSON artifacts that will constitute proof;
     ensure headless generation from a single command.

Priority problem approaches (instructions, not execution)

A) Photon photon EFT positivity

- Objective
  - Bound low energy Wilson coefficients for light by light scattering using
    subtracted dispersion relations under crossing and unitarity.

- Conventions to pin before coding
  - Helicity amplitude basis and normalization; definition of forward limit and
    small t derivatives; mapping between low energy coefficients and Wilson
    parameters; threshold and integration windows.

- Inputs to accept (future CLI flags)
  - Channels, expansion order, subtraction count, s range, t value or
    derivative order, quadrature and precision controls, and random seeds.

- Planned method
  - Assemble forward limit dispersion with a chosen number of subtractions.
  - Incorporate partial wave positivity and crossing for selected channels.
  - Encode constraints as a feasibility problem; return allowed region samples
    or vertices plus diagnostics on stability versus windows and subtractions.

- Diagnostics and residuals
  - Report sensitivity to subtraction count, energy window, and precision.
  - Emit a status block with any violations and the tightest constraints.

- Acceptance tests
  - Reproduce known SM sign patterns; bounds stable within quoted windows.

- Artifacts to produce later
  - JSON region, PNG plot, log with inputs, seeds, precision, and timings.

B) IR subtracted positivity with massless states

- Objective
  - Make positivity statements robust in channels with massless exchanges.

- Conventions to pin
  - Families of subtraction schemes and any pole exclusion protocols; report of
    regulator parameters and how invariance is assessed.

- Inputs to accept
  - ir scheme selection, number of subtractions, exclusion windows, precision.

- Planned method
  - Implement multiple subtraction families behind a common API; compute bounds
    under each; quantify scheme sensitivity; attempt regulator independent
    statements where possible.

- Diagnostics and residuals
  - Scheme sensitivity metrics; warnings when invariance is not achieved.

- Acceptance tests
  - Agreement across equivalent schemes within stated tolerances.

- Artifacts to produce later
  - Scheme comparison tables, overlapped bound plots, JSON diagnostics.

C) Landau singularity mapper for one loop topologies

- Objective
  - Map singular surfaces for triangles and boxes with SM like masses and
    verify against known loci.

- Conventions to pin
  - Topology descriptors, mass assignments, invariant definitions, and kinematic
    region limits; physical sheet conventions for classification.

- Inputs to accept
  - topology, mass list, invariant ranges, sampling density, precision.

- Planned method
  - Solve the stationary and on shell conditions symbolically; case split by
    masses and invariant signs; export inequality regions and parametric
    descriptions; sample numerically near predicted surfaces and confirm
    singular behavior with stable local evaluations.

- Diagnostics and residuals
  - Coverage of region decomposition; counts of solutions per region; spot
  checks near surfaces with measured blow up rates where applicable.

- Acceptance tests
  - Reproduce textbook loci for baseline cases and match numeric spot checks.

- Artifacts to produce later
  - JSON describing surfaces and regions, ASCII point clouds, PNG sketches.

Implementation hygiene to follow later

- Single source of truth for conventions; hardened parsing; deterministic seeds.
- High precision defaults with explicit trade offs; residual gates in CI.
- Headless plots and JSON only; no notebooks in version control.

## 2025-10-25 (IR subtraction pilot)
- Created `problems/positivity-with-light-states` to launch the first in-repo
  attempt on the massless exchange extension of the positivity program.
- Authored `ir_subtracted_positivity.wls` with 60 digit quadrature, hardened
  CLI parsing, and explicit handling of cutoff versus analytic pole
  subtraction. The heavy spectrum is a thresholded power law with tempering to
  keep the twice-subtracted kernel integrable while preserving fat tails.
- Ran
  `/Applications/Wolfram.app/Contents/MacOS/wolframscript -file problems/positivity-with-light-states/ir_subtracted_positivity.wls --cRen=0.01`
  and captured `summary_default.json`; the heavy integral `2.36e-2` produced a
  bound `7.51e-3`, leaving a safety margin `2.49e-3` for the supplied
  coefficient.
- Ran
  `/Applications/Wolfram.app/Contents/MacOS/wolframscript -file problems/positivity-with-light-states/ir_subtracted_positivity.wls --cRen=0.004 --heavyStrength=2.5 --heavyScale=4.0 --heavyThreshold=1.2 --growthPower=2.8 --tailExponent=6.2 --sCuts='[0.15,0.3,0.6]' --irSamples='[0.15,0.07,0.03]'`
  and stored `summary_tail_heavy.json`; the heavier tail amplified the bound to
  `4.92e-2` and flagged the coefficient as violating positivity.

## 2025-10-25 (Robust photon positivity LP)
- Re-read `RUNBOOK.md` and the approach playbook section in `NOTES.md`
  to confirm priority problem A requirements and to catalogue prior
  treatments (`problems/eft-positivity-photon-photon`, `problems/eft-positivity-dispersion`).
- Initial attempt to run `wolframscript` via `zsh -lc '... wolframscript ...'`
  failed with `command not found`; switched to the absolute path
  `/Applications/Wolfram.app/Contents/MacOS/wolframscript` per runbook guidance.
- Created `problems/eft-positivity-robust` and implemented
  `robust_positivity_lp.wls`, which formulates Pareto-capped spectral
  distributions as decision variables and solves the extremal `a1`, `a2`
  problems through linear programs expressed with `NMinimize`.
  The new workflow differs from earlier attempts by optimising over entire
  fat-tailed ensembles instead of evaluating fixed spectra, exposing worst-case
  Wilson coefficients under bounded moment uncertainty.
- Generated baseline bounds with
  `/Applications/Wolfram.app/Contents/MacOS/wolframscript -file problems/eft-positivity-robust/robust_positivity_lp.wls > problems/eft-positivity-robust/bounds_default.json`;
  observed that minimisers saturate 17 Pareto caps near `1.05 GeV`, while
  maximisers concentrate weight at `0.7 GeV`, expanding `a1` up to `2.39e2`.
- Executed a shallow-tail stress test via
  `/Applications/Wolfram.app/Contents/MacOS/wolframscript -file problems/eft-positivity-robust/robust_positivity_lp.wls --tailExponent=2.1 --capMultiplier=1.2 --massMax=150 --rho2Total=3.0 --evenTotal=0.8 > problems/eft-positivity-robust/bounds_shallow_tail.json`,
  confirming narrower bounds (`a1` confined between `1.27e2` and `1.86e2`) and
  full cap saturation across the interior grid.
- Ran a high-total, tight-tail scenario with
  `/Applications/Wolfram.app/Contents/MacOS/wolframscript -file problems/eft-positivity-robust/robust_positivity_lp.wls --tailExponent=4.5 --capMultiplier=3.0 --rho1Total=2.0 --rho2Total=2.5 --oddTotal=0.6 > problems/eft-positivity-robust/bounds_tight_tail.json`,
  showing that expanded totals widen the feasible region (`a1` reaching
  `2.99e2`) and that lower bounds still cling to the Pareto caps.
- Documented the methodology, differences from prior work, and usage patterns
  in `problems/eft-positivity-robust/README.md`, emphasising the convex
  optimisation perspective and the resilience diagnostics emitted per run.
- Consulted the current Wolfram documentation for `LinearOptimization` and
  `NMinimize` to ensure solver semantics aligned with the automated CLI flow.

- Confirmed the divergence table shows the cubic blow up of the unsubtracted
  pole, while the analytic counterterm zeroes the massless contribution exactly
  across all regulators, demonstrating the subtraction scheme independence of
  the renormalised bound.

## 2025-10-25 (Landau CLI integration)
- First `which wolframscript` check failed, exported `/Applications/Wolfram.app/Contents/MacOS` onto PATH per runbook before executing any WL commands.
- Current effort enhances the 2025-10-25 Landau mapper prototype by wiring its Cayley determinant machinery into `PhysicsCLI` via the new `landau-mapper` task.
- Refactored `landau_mapper.wls` into a thin wrapper that consumes the shared option spec so standalone usage mirrors the unified driver.
- Generated fresh outputs with the new task and wrapper:
  - `wolframscript -file physics_cli.wls --task=landau-mapper --topology=triangle --internalMasses='[0.7,0.8,0.9]' --externalSquares='[1.0,1.0,4.0]' --scanIndex=3 --scanRange='[0.1,6.0,200]' --output=json`
  - `wolframscript -file physics_cli.wls --task=landau-mapper --topology=box --internalMasses='[0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5]' --externalSquares='[0,0,0,0]' --sRange='[0.1,5.0,60]' --tRange='[0.1,5.0,60]' --output=json`
  - Corresponding wrapper invocations verify delegation, artefacts stored under `problems/landau-singularity-mapper/runs/cli-integration-2025-10-25/`.
- Updated RUNBOOK quick validation, domain playbook, and README to advertise the new task and CLI pathways.

## 2025-10-25 (Massless positivity ensemble sweep)
- Reviewed the approach playbook priority list and selected item B (IR subtracted positivity with massless states) for a new attempt focused on ensemble statistics.
- Differentiation from the earlier 2025-10-25 run: instead of a single deterministic heavy spectrum, this project will survey fat-tailed ensembles drawn from Pareto-type distributions, tracking how regulator prescriptions and tail indices reshape the renormalised bound distribution.
- Defined a deliverable set: standalone problem directory, CLI script that samples heavy tails via RandomVariate, JSON artifacts covering per-sample diagnostics and aggregate quantiles, and a README documenting methodology plus resilience checks.
- Established working assumptions for the sweep: enforce twice-subtracted dispersion with arbitrary precision integration, compare analytic pole subtraction against cutoff regularisation for each sample, and capture violations whenever user-specified coefficients miss the derived bound.
- Implemented `problems/massless-positivity-ensemble/ensemble_ir_subtraction.wls` with Pareto-controlled sampling, convergence guards, and JSON aggregation (bounded recursion, 60-digit precision).
- Baseline run `/Applications/Wolfram.app/Contents/MacOS/wolframscript -file problems/massless-positivity-ensemble/ensemble_ir_subtraction.wls > problems/massless-positivity-ensemble/ensemble_baseline.json` succeeded for all 16 samples; the renormalised bound distribution spans 2.85e-3 to 1.51e-2 with median 7.19e-3 and q90 1.45e-2.
- Test-coefficient sweep `/Applications/Wolfram.app/Contents/MacOS/wolframscript -file problems/massless-positivity-ensemble/ensemble_ir_subtraction.wls --cRen=0.01 > problems/massless-positivity-ensemble/ensemble_cren_0p01.json` flagged three violations (samples 2, 4, 10) giving a violation fraction 0.1875; margins range from -5.10e-3 to 7.15e-3, capturing both safety margin and failure modes.
- Stored both JSON artifacts in the problem directory for audit readiness and noted that analytic counterterms continue to cancel the pole exactly across all sampled residues.
- First `make smoke` invocation failed (`wolframscript: No such file or directory`) because the PATH in the build context omitted `/Applications/Wolfram.app/Contents/MacOS`; reran with `PATH=\"/Applications/Wolfram.app/Contents/MacOS:$PATH\" make smoke` and confirmed `tests run=4 failures=0`.

## 2025-10-25 (Landau classification pilot)
- Re-read the approach playbook priority item C and selected it for a fresh attempt that augments the existing determinant scan with Landau parameter diagnostics.
- Differentiation from the prior mapper (2025-10-25 Landau CLI integration): this pilot focuses on extracting the null eigenvectors of the Cayley matrix at each detected root, classifying solutions by positivity of the Landau parameters, and quantifying derivative slopes to flag degenerate zero crossings.
- Sketched deliverables: dedicated problem directory under `problems/landau-classifier-leading`, a Wolfram CLI script that wraps the shared parsing utilities yet adds classification logic, JSON artefacts covering triangle and box test cases with alpha-vectors and gradient magnitudes, and a README describing the methodology and resilience checks for fat-tailed scans.
- Confirmed the runbook requirements still hold (ASCII outputs, wl-only implementation, deterministic seeds) and noted that the new classifier must remain numerically stable near pinch surfaces where determinants become ill-conditioned.
- Drafted validation plan: reuse the previous root scan grids, cross-check alpha positivity against analytic expectations for equal-mass cases, and stress the classifier on near-degenerate configurations to ensure it either reports edge degeneracy or raises a diagnostic instead of mislabelling the singularity.
- Authored `problems/landau-classifier-leading/landau_classifier.wls`, binding the shared `PhysicsCLI` parsing spec, SVD null-vector extraction, determinant slope diagnostics, and an auxiliary bracketed root finder to stabilise candidate generation when Cayley matrices become nearly singular.
- Verified the triangle workflow via `wolframscript -file problems/landau-classifier-leading/landau_classifier.wls --topology=triangle --internalMasses='[0.7,0.8,0.9]' --externalSquares='[1.0,1.0,4.0]' --scanIndex=3 --scanRange='[0.1,6.0,200]' --workingPrecision=100 > problems/landau-classifier-leading/triangle_classification.json`, obtaining a single root at `s≈2.4431` with zero derivative, tiny residual `5.0e-13`, and a sign-indefinite alpha vector that confirms the forward Landau surface is not fully leading for that mass set.
- Evaluated the equal-mass box case at the known singular point using `wolframscript -file problems/landau-classifier-leading/landau_classifier.wls --topology=box --internalMasses='[0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5]' --externalSquares='[0,0,0,0]' --sRange='[0.1,5.0,80]' --tRange='[0.1,5.0,80]' --s=2.0 --t=2.0 --workingPrecision=120 > problems/landau-classifier-leading/box_classification.json`, which returned a `leading-positive` classification with symmetric simplex alphas and matched analytic gradients `(∂det/∂s, ∂det/∂t) = (4,4)`.
- Noted that the grid-based candidate harvester respects signed brackets but equal-mass configurations exhibit extended zero manifolds anchored at `s=0`, so automatic curve extraction still relies on user-specified evaluation points for now; documented this limitation in the README for follow-up refinement.

## 2025-10-25 (Dispersive photon positivity)
- Re-read the approach playbook priority list and selected item A for a new attempt focused on the partial-wave dispersion sum rules, explicitly contrasting the effort with the earlier direct inequality script.
- Created `problems/eft-positivity-dispersion` and implemented `spectral_dispersion.wls`, which evaluates the plus, minus, even, and odd brackets of Equation 3.11 in arXiv:2210.04675 using discrete delta spectral inputs with Pareto-sampled masses and weights.
- Resolved JSON export issues caused by Missing expressions by introducing a sanitiser and normalised candidate coefficient handling so the CLI stays ASCII safe.
- Generated the baseline dataset via `/Applications/Wolfram.app/Contents/MacOS/wolframscript -file problems/eft-positivity-dispersion/spectral_dispersion.wls > problems/eft-positivity-dispersion/baseline.json`, obtaining f2 ≈ 9.19e1 and g2 ≈ 9.81e2 with a1 ≈ 6.71e1 and a2 ≈ 5.56e1, and recorded that four resonances already account for more than eighty per cent of g2.
- Executed the stress run `/Applications/Wolfram.app/Contents/MacOS/wolframscript -file problems/eft-positivity-dispersion/spectral_dispersion.wls --seed=20251026 --samples=32 --tailExponent=2.2 --candidateCoefficients='{"a1":50.0,"a2":45.0}' > problems/eft-positivity-dispersion/stress_tail.json`, confirming that heavier tails drive g2 above 2.16e3 while the candidate coefficients remain positive but fall to roughly one third of the computed values.

## 2025-10-25 (Landau curve tracker)
- Sourced `~/.zprofile` and `~/.zshrc`, reviewed the approach playbook priority list, and selected priority C for a new attempt that targets continuous Landau surface extraction instead of pointwise classification.
- Created `problems/landau-curve-tracker`, implemented `landau_curve_tracker.wls`, and replaced the earlier continuation strategy with a rationalised secant predictor-corrector that advances via successive `FindRoot` solves under guarded slope denominators.
- Differentiated this workflow from `landau-classifier-leading` by tracking both forward and backward arcs in one invocation, logging slope and gradient evolution per point, and terminating gracefully when the implicit derivative threshold is reached, exposing fat-tailed pinch regions.
- Generated `box_equal_mass_curve.json` (parameterising t as a function of s across s in [0.2,4.0]) and `box_equal_mass_curve_tparam.json` (parameterising s in terms of t), each with residuals below `3e-15`, monotonic slope flattening, and explicit derivative guards near the branch locus.
- Recorded methodology, usage examples, output schema, and resilience considerations in `problems/landau-curve-tracker/README.md` to accompany the existing mapper and classifier deliverables.

## 2025-10-25 (Multi-scheme IR comparator)
- Re-read the approach playbook priority list for item B to confirm the open
  deliverables: expose multiple subtraction families, report regulator spreads,
  and surface worst-case positivity bounds under fat-tailed spectra.
- Compared existing attempts (`positivity-with-light-states`,
  `massless-positivity-ensemble`) and noted they treat one subtraction scheme
  at a time without computing bound deltas, spectral losses, or worst-case
  enforcement across a scheme catalogue.
- Created `problems/positivity-ir-multischeme` as the dedicated workspace for
  this new attempt.
- Authored `multi_scheme_ir_bounds.wls`, modularising argument parsing, heavy
  spectrum evaluation, scheme interval construction, counterterm accounting,
  and aggregation of renormalised bounds. Implemented scheme normalisation so
  JSON rule lists are accepted and added diagnostics for counterterm size,
  residual drift from the analytic baseline, and heavy spectral loss fractions.
- Ran the default command
  `/Applications/Wolfram.app/Contents/MacOS/wolframscript -file problems/positivity-ir-multischeme/multi_scheme_ir_bounds.wls`
  to produce `multi_scheme_default.json`. Analytic and cutoff schemes agree on
  a `7.51e-3` bound; excluding everything above `s = 2.0` trims the bound to
  `7.17e-3` with a `4.5%` spectral loss, while removing the band `[2.0, 2.8]`
  suppresses the bound to `5.24e-3` after discarding `30.3%` of the spectrum.
- Executed the tail-stress run
  `/Applications/Wolfram.app/Contents/MacOS/wolframscript -file problems/positivity-ir-multischeme/multi_scheme_ir_bounds.wls --heavyStrength=2.5 --heavyScale=4.0 --heavyThreshold=1.2 --growthPower=2.8 --tailExponent=6.2 --schemes='[{"scheme":"analytic"},{"scheme":"cutoff","sCut":0.2},{"scheme":"cutoff","sCut":0.12},{"scheme":"excludeBelow","sMin":1.8},{"scheme":"bandGap","sMin":1.8,"sMax":2.6},{"scheme":"bandGap","sMin":2.2,"sMax":3.6}]' --cRen=0.008`
  capturing `multi_scheme_tailstress.json`. The analytic bound jumps to
  `4.92e-2`; removing the band `[2.2, 3.6]` halves the bound to `2.73e-2`
  after eliminating `44.6%` of the spectrum, and all schemes flag the test
  coefficient `cRen = 8e-3` as violating positivity.
- Documented methodology, contrasts with earlier single-scheme workflows, and
  integration follow-ups in `problems/positivity-ir-multischeme/README.md`.

## 2025-10-25 16:47:00 UTC — Phase 0, Subphase 0.1 Scheme registry and option schemas
- Implemented IR scheme registry module at `lib/PhysicsCLI/IR.wl` with canonical parsing and validation for five schemes: analytic, cutoff, exclude_below, band_gap, principal_value. Canonicalization accepts legacy spellings (excludeBelow, bandGap, pv) and returns normalized names.
- Updated `problems/positivity-ir-multischeme/multi_scheme_ir_bounds.wls` to delegate interval construction and counterterm evaluation to the registry; kept integrator and payload unchanged. For principal_value the interval semantics match analytic at this phase; counterterm is zero, consistent with analytic subtraction baseline.
- Added `scripts/scheme_registry_selftest.wls`, a capped wolframscript harness that validates a mixed corpus and emits JSON. Verified with CPU cap `ulimit -S -t 10` and wall cap via Python `subprocess.run(timeout=15)` to avoid hangs.
- Verification results: selftest returned `validCount=8` and `invalidCount=6`, with empty `validFailures` and `invalidPasses`. Wall clock under 1.0 s on Mac mini m4 Pro. Artifact captured at `/tmp/scheme_selftest.json` during the run.
- Attempted an additional guarded run of `multi_scheme_ir_bounds.wls` including principal_value; initial attempts tripped zsh quoting of JSON and a sanitize routine that mapped across function heads. Fixed by switching to Python timeout wrapper and replacing the mapping sanitizer with a structural `SanitizeJSON` that recurses only over associations and lists.
- Remaining issue: one JSON export path still failed during the multi-scheme quick run when piping directly via Python wrapper. Given subphase 0.1 acceptance focuses on parsing/validation and artifact production, proceeded after the selftest passed under caps. I will revisit end-to-end multi-scheme JSON export in subphase 0.2 alongside quadrature guard wiring.
- Git: committed and pushed changes on `main` with message `feat(subphase): add IR scheme registry and option schemas [phase:0 subphase:0.1]`.
- Next subphase: 0.2 Certified quadrature wrappers.

## 2025-10-25 16:56:00 UTC — Phase 0, Subphase 0.3 Primal-dual LP scaffolding
- Replaced NMinimize-based objective solves with LinearOptimization and added certificate extraction: primal minimizer/value, dual maximizer/value, duality gap, and KKT residual diagnostics (equality residual, inequality violation, complementary slackness).
- Added `scripts/lp_cert_selftest.wls` to validate the certification path on a toy LP. Output shows dualityGap=0 and all KKT residuals at 0 within numeric tolerance.
- Guarded execution via `ulimit -S -t 60`, external wall measurement with `/usr/bin/time -l`. Observed wall 0.84 s, RSS ~ 166 MB on the Mac mini m4 Pro.
- Known issue: the enriched JSON export from `problems/eft-positivity-robust/robust_positivity_lp.wls` needs a follow-up sanitization pass to avoid rare symbolic remnants in payload; the selftest path is clean and meets acceptance.
- Next subphase: 0.4 CI harness and timeouts.
